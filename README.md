# Worknest

**An open-source project and task manager built for software development teams**

Worknest is a modern, high-performance project management tool built entirely in Rust. It provides a responsive web application that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers, giving developers a fast, reliable, and extensible platform for managing projects and tasks.

## Features (Planned)

### MVP (v1.0)
- User authentication and session management
- Project management (create, organize, archive)
- Comprehensive ticket system (tasks, bugs, features)
- Multiple views: List, Kanban board
- Priority and status tracking
- Responsive web UI powered by egui
- Works on desktop and mobile browsers

### Future Releases
- **v2.0**: Advanced features (custom fields, workflows, reporting)
- **v3.0**: Plugin system with WASM-based extensibility
- **v4.0**: Cloud sync and collaboration features
- **v5.0+**: AI assistance, progressive web app, advanced integrations

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the complete development plan.

## Why Worknest?

- **Performance**: Built in Rust for maximum speed and efficiency
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile browsers
- **Developer-Focused**: Built by developers, for developers
- **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom integrations (coming in v3.0)
- **Open Source**: Free forever, community-driven development

## Architecture

Worknest follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
worknest/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worknest-core/       # Core business logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worknest-db/         # Database layer (SQLite)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worknest-auth/       # Authentication
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worknest-api/        # Backend API server
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ worknest-gui/        # Web UI (egui/WASM)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worknest-plugins/    # Plugin system (future)
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) for building the web application (`cargo install trunk`)
- wasm32 target (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DScudeler/Worknest.git
cd Worknest

# Build the web application
trunk build --release

# The built files will be in the dist/ directory
```

### Development

```bash
# Run the web application in development mode with hot reload
trunk serve

# The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# Check code formatting
cargo fmt --check

# Run linter
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
