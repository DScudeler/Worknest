# Worknest Roadmap

## Product Vision

Worknest is a modern, open-source project and task management system designed specifically for software development teams. Built with Rust for performance and reliability, it combines a powerful WASM-based GUI with a flexible backend architecture that supports local-first workflows and advanced extensibility through plugins.

**Core Principles:**
- **Performance First**: Leverage Rust's speed and safety
- **Local-First**: Work offline with local SQLite, sync when ready
- **Extensible**: Rich plugin system for custom workflows
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built by developers, for developers
- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop apps via egui, web via WASM

---

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Rust (stable)
- **GUI Framework**: egui (immediate mode GUI)
- **WASM Runtime**: wasm-bindgen, wasm-pack
- **Database**: SQLite (local), with migration path to PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, bcrypt for password hashing
- **Serialization**: serde (JSON/bincode)
- **Plugin System**: wasmer/wasmtime for WASM plugins
