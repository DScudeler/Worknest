# Web GUI - Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: The GUI has been implemented with demo mode functionality.

## Implementation Summary

All screens have been updated to work with in-memory demo data, providing a fully functional UI without requiring a backend server. This allows for:
- Local development and testing
- UI/UX evaluation
- Responsive design validation on desktop and mobile

## Demo Mode Features

### Authentication ✅
- [x] `login.rs` - Demo login creates local user
- [x] `register.rs` - Demo registration creates local user

### Projects ✅
- [x] `dashboard.rs` - Displays demo projects from AppState
- [x] `project_list.rs` - Full CRUD operations on demo projects
- [x] `project_detail.rs` - View project details and associated tickets

### Tickets ✅
- [x] `ticket_list.rs` - Full CRUD operations on demo tickets
- [x] `ticket_board.rs` - Kanban board view of demo tickets
- [x] `ticket_detail.rs` - View and edit ticket details

## API Client Status

The `api_client.rs` module is **fully implemented** with all necessary methods for:
- Authentication (login, register)
- User management
- Project CRUD operations (including archive/unarchive)
- Ticket CRUD operations

## Switching to Real API

When the backend API is ready, switching from demo mode to real API calls requires:

1. **Uncomment API client calls** in each screen method (marked with TODO comments)
2. **Remove demo data operations**
3. **Implement async state management** for handling API responses

Example transition:
```rust
// Current demo mode:
state.demo_projects.push(project);

// Replace with API call (example in comments):
// wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local(async move {
//     match api_client.create_project(token, request).await {
//         Ok(project) => { /* update state */ },
//         Err(e) => { /* handle error */ },
//     }
// });
```

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Build web application
trunk build --release

# Serve for development (with hot reload)
trunk serve

# The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Testing

The application is fully functional in demo mode:
1. ✅ User registration and login
2. ✅ Project creation, archiving, and management
3. ✅ Ticket creation and management
4. ✅ Responsive UI adapts to desktop and mobile viewports
